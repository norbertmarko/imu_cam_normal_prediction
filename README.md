## Clone the Repository

The commands below are Linux-based. To run the code, you can either use WSL2 with Ubuntu 22.04 or native Ubuntu (tested with 22.04).

Clone project (with submodules):
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://norbertmarko.github.io/imu_cam_normal_prediction/
```
```bash
cd ground-normal-prediction
```
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Installation

Create environment (you need [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/) for this).

Create conda environment and install dependencies:
```bash
cd ground-normal-prediction
```
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

Activate conda environment (every new console used):
```bash
conda activate ground-normal-prediction
```

Install `pandaset-devkit` in the environment.

```bash
cd src/_ref/pandaset_devkit
```
Activate your conda environment (this is where we pip install the devkit)
```bash
conda activate ground-normal-prediction
```

`cd` into `pandaset_devkit/python` (assuming you are already in `pandaset_devkit`)
```bash
cd python
```
Install the devkit
```bash
pip install .
```

## Prepare Evaluation
You can find the example data on the following [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ee7xGS2pCp-vJqfjuuMSpEZ_EmV_g6Pa?usp=drive_link).

1. Download `PandaSet.zip` from the link above and uncompress the data.
2. Modify the `data_root` variable in the `src/configs/paths/paths_panda.yaml` file in the repository. It should point to the uncompressed `PandaSet` directory. For example: `"/media/norbert/T7/PandaSet"`
3. Download the generated ground truth (`gt_panda.zip`) from the link above and uncompress the data.
4. Put the uncompressed ground truth folder into the `results` directory in the repository root.

## Run Code

> 💡 Before running any of the scripts, go into the repository root, and activate the conda environment as described above.

You can find the generated results in the results directory in the repository root (the sub-folder names should match the script names closely).

To run the algorithm described in the paper, use the main script:
```bash
python src/run_exp_hg_panda_ts.py
```

You can also run the SOTA method, using the following python script:
```bash
python src/run_ref_gnf_panda.py
```

Run the evaluation script, after you ran both our method and the SOTA method for a certain sequence (default: 039):
```bash
python src/eval/eval.py
```
- (optional) To avoid the following error: `[matplotlib.font_manager][WARNING] - findfont: Font family 'Arial' not found.` Run the following command (move with the arrows and accept with enter when the license agreement appears in the console):
    ```bash
    sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer && rm -rf ~/.cache/matplotlib
    ```
    - You can still see the evaluation at the top of the console without installing the fonts.



You can re-generate the ground truth (for any sequence) using the following script (set the `data_root` and `seq_num` in `configs/paths/paths_panda.yaml`):
```bash
python src/gt/gen_gt_normal_panda.py
```
